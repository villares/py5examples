## Converting the Processing Python mode examples to py5

### A first attempt, you can help!

This is a very rough convertion, you can help by testing the examples and opening an issue!

Open an issue here if you find a broken example: https://github.com/villares/py5examples/issues


### How to run this code?

To run this, you'll need [py5](https://py5coding.org). I strongly suggest using [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org) and the [thonny-py5mode](https://github.com/tabreturn/thonny-py5mode/) plugin.

### Conversion notes

This might need change in the future:

- `from py5 import *` for secondary .py files of a sketch

Try some numpy optimization?

- Basics/Math/Graphing2DEquation/Graphing2DEquation.py

Not good:

- Topics/Create Shapes/ParticleSystemPShape/ParticleSystemPShape.py
