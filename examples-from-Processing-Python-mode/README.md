## Converting the Processing Python mode examples to py5

### A first attempt

This is a very rough convertion, you can help by testing the examples and opening an issue!

### Conversion notes

This might need change in the future:
- {{1}} `from py5 import *` for secondary .py files of a sketch

Try some numpy optimization?

- Basics/Math/Graphing2DEquation/Graphing2DEquation.py

Not good:
